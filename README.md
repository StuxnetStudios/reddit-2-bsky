# reddit-2-bsky

This repository contains the `reddit-to-bsky` Windows automation app in the
`reddit-to-bsky/` subdirectory.

To view the full project documentation, open the `README.md` inside that
folder (or click the directory on GitHub).

```text
cd reddit-to-bsky
code README.md
```

The executable and source files live under `reddit-to-bsky/` – the root level
only holds auxiliary files (license, original drafts, etc.).

## Quick start

```powershell
cd reddit-to-bsky
# run the bot from published output or build it with 'dotnet publish'
```
